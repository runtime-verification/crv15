</center>
<P> You can <A HREF="spd3_14.zip">download the latest version of the SPD</A> 
  (currently 3.14), and also <a href="http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/SPD/spd.pdf">view
  the original IEEE CG&amp;A article</a> from Nov. 1987. This software package is not copyrighted and can be used freely 
  (for example, <A HREF="http://www.europa.com/~keithr/">WCT2POV</A>, a good 3D 
  file converter for Windows, uses SPD's libvec.c graphics library). All source 
  is in K&R vanilla C (though ANSI headers can be enabled) and has been used on 
  many systems. A MacOS version can be found on <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Horizon/4977/macspd.html">Eduard 
  Schwan's SPD page</A>.
<P>For a newer set of more realistic environments for benchmarking ray tracers 
  (or renderers in general), see <a href="http://www.ce.chalmers.se/BART/">BART: 
  A Benchmark for Animated Ray Tracing</a>. The focus is software that generates 
  an animated set of frames for a ray tracer to render. These scenes use an NFF-like 
  language (AFF), and the authors provide a number of tools for parsing and visualization.
<P>
This software is meant to act as a set of basic test images for ray tracing
algorithms.  The programs generate databases of objects which are fairly
familiar and "standard" to the graphics community, such as the teapot, a
fractal mountain, a tree, a recursively built tetrahedral structure, etc.  I
originally created them for my own testing of ray tracing efficiency schemes.
Since their first release other researchers have used them to test new
algorithms.  In this way, research on algorithmic improvements can be compared
in a more standardized fashion.  If one researcher ray-traces a car, another a
tree, the question arises, "How many cars to the tree?"  With these databases
we may be comparing oranges and apples, but it's better than comparing oranges
and orangutans.
Using these statistics
along with the same scenes allows us to compare results in a more meaningful
way.
<P>
Another interesting use for the SPD has been noted:  debugging.  By
comparing the images and the statistics with the output of your own ray tracer,
you can detect program errors.  For example, "mount" is useful for checking if
refraction rays are generated correctly, and "balls" (a.k.a. "sphereflake")
can check for the correctness of eye and reflection rays.
<P>
The images for these databases and other information about them can be
found in <a href="http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/SPD/spd.pdf"><B>A Proposal for Standard Graphics Environments</B></a>, <I>IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications</I>, vol. 7, no. 11, November 1987, pp. 3-5.  See
<I>IEEE CG&A</I>, vol. 8, no. 1, January 1988, p. 18 for the correct image of
the tree database (the only difference is that the sky is blue, not orange).
The teapot database was added later.
<P> The <A HREF="NFF.TXT">Neutral File Format</a> (NFF) is the default output 
  format from SPD programs. This format is trivial to parse (if you can use sscanf, 
  you can parse it), and each type of object is defined in human terms (e.g. a 
  cone is defined by two endpoints and radii). The basic shapes supported are 
  polygon and polygon patch (normal per vertex), cylinder, cone, and sphere. Note 
  that there are primitives supported within the SPD which are not part of NFF, 
  e.g. heightfield, NURBS, and torus, so more elaborate programs can be written. 
  If a format does not support a given primitive, the primitive is tessellated 
  and output as polygons. 
<P>
Other output formats are
supported:
<UL>
<LI>
        POV-Ray 1.0
<LI>
        POV-Ray 2.0 to 2.2
<LI>
        POV-Ray 3.1
<LI>
        Polyray 1.4 to 1.6
<LI>
        Vivid 2.0
<LI>
        QRT 1.5
<LI>
        Rayshade 4.0.6
<LI>
        RTrace 8.0.0
<LI>
        Art 2.3 (from Vort)
<LI>
        RenderMan RIB

        AutoCAD DXF [object data only]

        Wavefront OBJ format (polygons only)
<LI>
        RenderWare RWX script file
<LI>
        Apple 3DMF
<LI>
        VRML 1.0
<LI>
        VRML 2.0
</UL>
Alexander Enzmann receives most of the credit for creating the various
file format output routines, along with many others who contributed.
<P>
There are also reader programs for the various formats.  Currently the
following formats can be read and converted:
<UL>
<LI>
	NFF
<LI>
	DXF (just 3DFACEs)
<LI>
	OBJ
</UL>
This makes the NFF format a nice, simple language for quickly creating
models (whether by hand or by program), as any NFF file can be converted to many
different formats.  Warnings:
<UL>
<LI>
The conversions tend to be verbose in many cases (e.g. there is currently
no code in place to group polygons of the same material into polygon
mesh primitives used in some formats).
<LI>
No real tessellation of polygons is done when needed for conversion,
all that happens are that polygon fans are created.
<LI>
You might find the images you obtain are mirror reversed with some formats
(e.g. VRML 2.0 files).
</UL>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/tog/GraphicsGems/">Graphics
Gems V</A> code distribution has a simple z-buffer renderer by Raghu
Karinthi, using NFF as the input language.
<P>
On hashing: a sore point in mount.c, the fractal mountain generator, has been
its hashing function. Mark VandeWettering has provided a great hashing function
by <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bob_jenkins/blockcip.htm">Bob Jenkins</A>.
To show what a difference it makes, check out images of models made with the
<A HREF="old.jpg">original hash function</A> with a large size factor,
<A HREF="new.jpg">replacement hash function</A> I wrote (still no cigar),
and

distribution.
