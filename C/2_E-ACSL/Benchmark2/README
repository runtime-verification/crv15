This example comes from the Buffer overflow benchmark models from MIT available
at www.cs.virginia.edu/~mc2zk/security_test_suites/buffer_overflow_bench_models.tar.gz.

See K. Kratkiewicz and R. Lippman, "Using a Diagnostic Corpus of C Programs to Evaluate Buffer Overflow Detection by Static Analysis Tools", 2005, for details.

In this test, we are looking for detecting an invalid call to memcpy where the
output buffer is not big enough to copy the input one. This invalid call is
marked /*BAD*/ in iquery-bad.c.

Our formal specification to memcpy which allows our tool to find the bug is in
iquery-spec.h. It verifies that the destination buffer may contains at least __n
characters.

To compile the program, run "make iquery-bad",
then run it with "./iquery-bad b3.in".

The monitored trace should look like:

=====
opcode = 1
req: IQuery class 1 type 1
Copying 27 bytes from fname to anbuf which can store 2 bytes
ERROR FOUND on memcpy

just after the invalid call to memcpy
=====
