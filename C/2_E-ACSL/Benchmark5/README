We would like to verify that there is no signed overflow.
The formal specification is written in overflow-spec.c: this function 'main'
has been automatically generated by Frama-C (for x86-64).

Just compile the monitored file with your favorite C compiler and execute the
output.

This output should contain a trace looking as:

=====
i = 2147483647 (x = -2147483646)
Assertion failed at line 336 in function main.
The failing predicate is:
rte: signed_overflow: i+1 <= 2147483647.
i = -2147483648 (x = 1)
Assertion failed at line 329 in function main.
The failing predicate is:
rte: signed_overflow: -2147483647 <= i.
=====
