We would like to verify that each function frees the localy allocated memory.
The formal specification is written in size-spec.h.

Just compile the monitored file with your favorite C compiler and execute the
output.

This output should contain a trace looking as:

=====
Calling function f...
101 ERROR FOUNDS // each 101 calls to function 'f' are invalid
The result is 101.
Calling function g...
The result is 10001.
Exiting.
ERROR FOUND // the main does not free its local allocated memory
=====
